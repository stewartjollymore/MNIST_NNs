# MNIST_NNs
developing NNs from scratch

This repo will host all the neural networks that I build from scratch.

There will be various levels for what "from scratch" means. My first attempt will be bulding a fully connected NN without
the use of TF NN architecture, these attempts can be found in the [Numpy NNs](https://github.com/stewartjollymore/MNIST_NNs/tree/main/Numpy%20NNs) folder.

I will also recreate all "from scratch" models using TF in the [TF NNs] folder


**in dev**
