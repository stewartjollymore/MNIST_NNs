# This is a folder that houses NN's that are built truly from scratch

I have not implimented any TF or PT frameworks on these NNs and they serve to display my understanding
of NN structure.


I do use the `np.dot()` functionality but hand code all activation functions and their derivatives along with
the use of custom developed error metrics and their gradient functions as well.
